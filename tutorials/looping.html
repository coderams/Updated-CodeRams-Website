        "In other words, the code will run [some code] until [boolean expression] evaluates to false, and then proceed to run [more code].",

        "Note that if the boolean expression in the while loop is never satisfied, the while loop will be an infinite loop, and the program will never finish running. This is a common mistake when using while loops.",

        "The for loop will loop from 0 to [upper limit], and run [some code] each time.",
        "One very important thing to note about for loops in Python is that they will not run [some code] when \"increment\" is equal to [upper limit].",
        "For example, if you had a for loop where [upper limit] was equal to 10, and the code printed out \"increment\", the code would print 0, 1, 2, and 3, all the way up to 9, but it would not print 10.",

        "To do this, we'll need to put a second for loop inside of the main one. We'll call the other incrementing variable \"j\" (because we can't have two variables with the same name).",
