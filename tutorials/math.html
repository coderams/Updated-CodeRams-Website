        "The easiest way to check if one number is a divisor of another is to use the mod operator. If x mod y is equal to zero, then y is a divisor of x. If x mod y is not equal to zero, then y is not a divisor of x.",
        "For example, this code reads in two space-separated numbers, and checks whether or not the second number is a divisor of the first:",

        "This technique can be used to find all divisors of a number.",

        "To speed it up, we can notice that if a number i is a divisor of n, then n / i is also a divisor of n. For example, 2 is a divisor of 12, and 12 / 2 = 6 is also a divisor of 12.",

        "The first key observation with prime factors is that the smallest divisor of a number (other than one) is always a prime factor.",
        "This is because every divisor of a number is either a prime factor of the number, or a product of prime factors of the number. The smallest divisor can't be the product of any prime factors, because if it was, they would be smaller than the divisor, so the smallest divisor of any number has to be a prime factor.",
        "Once we find the smallest divisor, we can factor it out of the number entirely. We already know that the divisor we just found is a prime factor, so we don't need to worry about it anymore, and dividing out the smallest prime factor will not change any of the other prime factors of the number.",

        "Now, we divide 84 by two until it is no longer divisible by two. After we divide it by two, it becomes 42, which is still divisible by two. We divide 42 by two and get 21, which isn't divisible by two. Now, we can add two to the list of prime factors, and run the algorithm on 21.",
