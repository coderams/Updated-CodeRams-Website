      "A 2D list is a list, where each element is another list. Each element of these additional lists could be integers, strings, or even other lists (making it a 3D list).",
      "2D lists have many important applications in coding problems. We'll discuss them in detail in this tutorial.",
      "[big]Basics of 2D Lists",
      "[med]Defining 2D Lists",
      "First, let's discuss how to define a 2D list.",
      "To immediately define a 2D list, we can do something similar to how you define a 1D list. Like defining a 1D list, you separate each element with a comma, and enclose the list in square brackets. However, in this case, each element is another list, and we define each one in a similar way.",
      "[cd]example2Dlist = [[1, 2], [4, 6], [11, 13]]",
      "This code example defines a 2D list with three elements, with each sub-list having two elements. Note that the sub-lists of a 2D list don't all have to be the same length. In fact, you can even have a list where some elements are lists, and other elements are integers or strings. This is only rarely useful in coding problems, however.",
      "[med]Accessing Elements of 2D Lists",
      "Accessing each sub-list in a 2D list works similar to accessing individual elements in a 1D list. Let's say we have the following 2D list:",
      "[cd]another2Dlist = [[7, 9, 3, 4], [8, 4, 6, 8], [1, 1, 2, 5]]",
      "Then, to print out the first element of the 2D list, we could use the following code:",
      "[cd]print(another2Dlist[0])",
      "This prints out the first element of the 2D list, which is the following:",
      "[cd][7, 9, 3, 4]",
      "To print out an individual element from a 2D list, we can first cast one of its sub-lists to another variable, and access an individual element in the sub-list, like this:",
      "[cd]my2Dlist = [[7, 8, 4], [3, 6, 9], [1, 1, 2]]",
      "[cd]firstElement = my2Dlist[0]",
      "[cd]individualElement = firstElement[0]",
      "This code will store 7 in individualElement, the first element of the first sub-list of my2Dlist.",
      "This code can be condensed into one line, like this:",
      "[cd]my2Dlist = [[7, 8, 4], [3, 6, 9], [1, 1, 2]]",
      "[cd]individualElement = my2Dlist[0][0]",
      "This has the same effect as the previous code sample. In other words, to access any element in a 2D list, use two bracketed identifiers, with the first one representing the sub-list that contains the element, and the second one representing the index of the element in the sub-list.",
      "For example, this code will print 9, the 3rd element in the 2nd sub-list of my2Dlist. (Remember that all lists use zero-based indexing.)",
      "[cd]my2Dlist = [[7, 8, 4], [3, 6, 9], [1, 1, 2]]",
      "[cd]print(my2Dlist[1][2])",
      "[med]Reading 2D Lists",
      "In most coding problems involving 2D lists, the input will consist of a grid representation of the 2D list, where each element in each sub-list may or may not be separated by a space, depending on the problem. For example, here's a possible input for a 5 by 5 2D list:",
      "[cd]0 9 7 8 2",
      "[cd]3 9 6 2 1",
      "[cd]3 4 3 3 2",
      "[cd]0 8 8 1 5",
      "[cd]2 3 9 1 0",
      "To read in a 2D list in this format, we can read each sub-list one at a time, and add each one to the 2D list using the append command. The code will look like this:",
      "[cd]my2Dlist = []",
      "[cd]for i in range(0, 5):",
      "[cd]    sublist = [int(j) for j in input().split(\" \")]",
      "[cd]    my2Dlist.append(sublist)",
      "[big]2D Grids",
      "The \"classic\" use for 2D lists is for 2D grids, which could be labyrinths, matrices, or maps. Problems involving these topics usually require 2D lists.",
